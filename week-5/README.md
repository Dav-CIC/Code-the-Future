### Introduction
It's time to hand things over to you! There are no lessons this week as you
have time to work on your personal projects. A project portfolio will help you when 
applying for roles as it will showcase your skills. We will help you create an app
that you will host publicly on GitHub pages.

### Session goals
- To create your own application!

### Example projects
We aren't looking for a masterpiece. This is time for you to practice your new skills 
and dive deeper into web development with the tutors support.
